# Autoencoder-Deep-Learning

•	This project contains code for denoising autoencoder developed using google colab and text reconstruction application using TensorFlow Subclassing API.
•	In the project I have developed and compared Multi-layer deep neural network model and CNN complex model, for reconstructing corrupted text on greyscale images and achieved the RMSE of 0.0398.
